## Game Mechanics
### Side View
### Autonomous NPC's
### Actions/Effects (Min. 3)
There are two types of usable items on Path of Excellence:
- **Actions:** Can be positioned on a point in the map. The first student that picks it up, uses it to perform a specific action and then returns to acting normally, assuming it did not die in the process.
- **Effects:** Can be given to specific students, changing their status and giving that specific student an ability. A student cannot have more than one effect active over itself at the same time.
#### Action : Calculator
You can give a calculator to a student. As soon as a student picks this effect, he/she will calculate a bar plot that will form an ascending stairway that allows him/her to ascend himself/herself a bit.
#### Effect : Study
You can command a student to study. After using this action on a student, if they find a pile of papers in their way, they won't go back anymore, instead reading the contents of the pile of papers and removing them from the map, for others to be able to traverse it.
### Obstacles (Min. 2)
#### Environmental Obstacles
The students can find difficulties merely by the design of the level, such as:
- Holes that will kill them if they fall inside them
- Cliffs that will kill them if they don't have a way of descenting safely from them
- Walls that will make them go back when they find them, forcing them to either find another way or use some action/effect to climb them
#### Piles of Paper
Piles of Paper can be found blocking the way to the exit. Students that encounter them will just start walking back unless they are given some command that allows them to deal with them or go around them.
### Level Exit
